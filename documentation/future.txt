Future

New desires
	Ubicomp
	Internet scale computing
	Data intensive supercomputing

New technologies
	flash-based disk drives
	Flash replacement: Phase change memory (PCM)
	Multi-threaded multi-core processors
	Better tools for handling complexity
	
Ubicomp
	Computers are all over the place, but they're just part of the environment, not really in your face
	Lots of ongoing projects
		Aura(CMU), Oxygen(MIT), Endeavor(UBC), etc . . .
	Lots of interesting challenges
		low power and power management
		wireless networking
		real-time and on-time services
		computation and data migration
		addressing information overload
		security and privacy!
	
Internet wide computing
	Video conferencing and other forms of communicatiokln
	Grid computing
	Peer to peer lookup and storage systems
	PDA and other forms of remote information access
	Lots of projects
	Lots of interesting challenges
		resource discovery and selection
		person location
		data and/or computation survival and migration
		cost/benefit models
		security, privacy, and fighting denial of service attacks
		
Data Intensive Supercomputing
	Large scale computer centred around data
		Collecting maintaining indexing computing
	Think google-style computing
		millions of processors in local area clusters
		Comodity parts, reliability depends on redundancy and management
		partitioned workload
	Lots of examples of problems that fir this model
	Bit challenge is moving to data
		1TB is cheap to store, hard to move
New technologies
	Chanding technology requires changes in system management
	Moore's Law
		faster CPU, more memory, more storage, more bandwidth
	Shared memory parallel computing becomes mainstream
		Renewed interest in efficient synchronization, parallel scheduling, distributed shared memory
	Better wireless technologies, smaller devices
		Ubicomp vision becoming realistic
	Changes in storage technology
		Cheap, fast non-volatile storage simplifies many file system programs
		
Better tools
	Project AURA
		The most precious resource in computer system is no longer its processor, memory, disk or network.
			It is user attention
	Complexity of systems continues to grow, human ability to handle complexity does not
		Need better languages to specify and check concurrent programs
		Automatic extraction of rules from code, and verification that rules are followed
		Automatic diagnosis and recovers from errors
		Reduction to less complex systems




Non-programmable calculators will be allowed
Covers lecture 12 to 22 security
roughtly same weight per lecture
Expect mix of applications, knowledge and thinking questions
	Application
	Knowledge
	Thinking
Wil have more thinking / less pure knowledge last year
