#####################################LunOS 0.05.00 design goals #################################################

The primary goal of LunOS is Luls... as such our current focus is getting enough of a kernel together to create a NES
emulator.

In order to do this we will need...

- VGA Driver
- Graphics Interface Library (for said driver / program interaction)
- DMA Control
- FileSystem Access
- USB Support (last thing to do)
- Hard drive driver
- Sound Driver

(If built in user space)
- User Space programs
- User Space Library
(Alternativly we could build this program in kernel space, probably the best option to start with)
