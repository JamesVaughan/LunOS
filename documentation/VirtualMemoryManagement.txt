Memory Management Requirements:
	Relocation:
		Pogrammers don't know what physical memory will be available when their programs run
			need some type of address translation
	Protection
		A proccess' memory should be protected from unwanted access by other resources.
		Requires hardware support
	Sharing
		Needs ways to specify and control what sharing is allowed
	Logical/Physical Orgnization
		Map between program strucutres and linear array of bytes
		Manage transfers between disk and main memory

Clustered page tables:
	Similar to hashed page tables
		Each entry stores mapping information for several consecutive pages with a single key
		Hashed page tables with subblocking
		
------------SuperPages------------------
Overview
	Increasing cost in TLB miss overhead
		Growing working sets
		TLB size does not grow at same pace
	Processors now provide superpages
		one TLB entry can map a large region
	OS's have been slow to harness them
		no transparent superpage support for apps
		
TLB coverage Trend
	TLB coverage as percentage of memory has a 1000 decrease in 15 years
How to increase the coverage
	Typical TLB coverage ish 1 mb
	Use Superapages
		Both large and smal pages -power of 2 size
		1 TLB entry per superpage
		Contiguous, and virtually and physically aligned
		Uniform attributes
	Benefit: Increased TLB coverage
		no increase in TLB size
		no internal fragmentation (if we do it carefully)
		
Problems with superPages
	Main Issues
		Allocation
		Promotion
		Demotion
		Fragmentation
		
Design of Navarro et al.
	Uses preemptible reservations
		When you get a fault on one page that might be part of a super page make a resurvation aligned to a super page
			How much do we reserve? and how do we make a decision?
			How do we reduce internal fragmentation?
		Key Observation
			Once an application touches the first page of a memory object,
				then it is likely going to touch every page of that object.
			Create super pages as large as possible and as early as possible

Linux effort is underway, however it is complicated b the linux page table design
