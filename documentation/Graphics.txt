Commands:
0 - End of commands, the last command, signalling that we have finished rendering this batch of commands
1 - Change Graphics Mode, 0 - text 1 - graphics(320x200)
2 - Render pixel, unsigned int x, unsigned int y, byte r, byte g, byte b
3 - Render rect, unsigned int x, unsigned int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height, byte r, byte g, byte b
4 - Render bitmap, unsigned int x, unsigned int y, unsigned int width, unsigned int height, ptr* bitmap
5 - Render Font, unsigned int x, unsigned int y, unsigned char* text, Font* font
